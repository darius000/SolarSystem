This is a side project using Three.js (JavaScript library for webGL ). This project is a small display of our Solar System with only a few satellites of each planet added (hope to add more in the future). The user can view each planet and its satellites by selecting it from the User Interface (UI). The satellites are shown on the UI only if the number of satellites of a planet is greater than 0. The user can rotate the view around the object, as well as zoom in and out and pan. You can reset the view if the object is out of focus, the controls are displayed and can be changed in the UI as well. Interactable Solar System can be found here https://darius000.github.io/SolarSystem/.
